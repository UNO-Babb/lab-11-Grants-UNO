The results that were generated when running the provided code were an average wait time of 1.64 minutes and total idle time of 757 minutes.
This idle time is far too high, so a reasonabl response would be to lessen the amount of checkers.
However, being that it is the holiday season, the range of what the amount of items could be was increased to a maximum of 50.
With the increased number of items, I chose to include 3 checkers.
This combo produced an average wait time of 3.34 minutes with 274 minutes of idle time.
If two checkers were used instead the amount of wait time would increase to 4.99 minutes, but the idle time would decrease to 96 minutes.
I believe that it would be more beneficial to have a extra checker working to save customers almost two minutes of wait time.
